Quick Tutorial on Console.php for command line processes - Author: Jaymes H. Sorbel

- Purpose: To provide other developers information on how to develop and run command line processes

- Creating a command line process class.

1. Create a new command class inside the app\Console folder. To group logical command line processes you may create a folder under Console to place your class.

2.  The command line class would have a minimum of this structure:

        <?php declare(strict_types = 1);

        namespace App\Console;

        // include use path\to\class here
        class zzExample
        {
            // private variables for this class
            private $variables;

            public function __construct()
            {
                // The class has getenv and the app\Library\Config class access
                // Config is initialized with config\settings.php data

                /* you must initialize anything else you need here */

            }

            /* This is the function that is called by Console.php */
            /* it must be present in the class
            public function run ()
            {
                /* run your commands */
            }

            /* create more private functions as needed */

        } // end zzExample

3.  To run your command line process

    php path/to/app/Console/Console.php ClassName

    For example:
    php path/to/app/Console/Console.php Migrate

    If you created a sub-folder in Console for like command line class files.  Use this format:

    php path/to/app/Console/Console.php SubFolder:ClassName

    The : (colon) is the folder delimeter.  For Example:
    php path/to/app/Console/Console.php zzExample:zzExample

4.  An example command line process class can be found in app\Console\zzExample\zzExample.php
