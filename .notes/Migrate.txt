Quick Tutorial on Database Migration - Author: Jaymes H. Sorbel

- Purpose: To provide other developers updates you made to the base database required for your development within the framework.

- Base Database:  The base database is located at config/Tracksz-2020-02-21.sql.  This must
  already created on your local development database system before you use Migrate.

- Migration Folder: Migration files are located in the folder config/migrations

- Steps.

1. Create a new file in the Migration Folder with the following naming convention

   YYYY-MM-DD-sss-nn-short-description.sql

   - sss: Developers initials. For instance Jaymes H. Sorbel = JHS
   - nn:  Count of migrations files you created that day, such as 01, 02, 03...
          The first one of the day should always start with 01, don't leave it out.
   - short-description: What the SQL is doing to the database.  For instance create-marketplace
                        or create-shipping-tables.

   ** Naming convention is important as it sorts the files and executes them in that order.

   An example file name: 2020-02-21-JHS-01-add-key-member-table.sql

2. Add valid SQL to the file and save it.

3. Run Migrate command located in app/Console.  The syntax from the framework root is:

   php app/Console/Console.php Migrate

   * you can run from other locations in the framework but you'll have to adjust the path to Console.php

   * If your SQL is not valid, you'll receive an error message and your migration will not be saved in the Migrations table.  The Migrations table stores all "completed" migrations.

4. There is no Rollback: If you have to change something you did in a previous migration, create a new migration file with the SQL that makes that change.
